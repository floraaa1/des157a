        <p>The article impresses me with its many valuable tips about form design. It also mentions some details that I had overlooked before. Those details are essential to users and will change their desire to complete the form. For example, in the article, 21% of people in the research say that they abandoned the process because of too long/complicated checkout. Therefore, minimizing the input field is the best way for users to continue filling out the form. I agree with it because it happens to me. Once I fill out a form about the desirability of the restaurant, I expect to fill in several easy questions. However, there are multiple-choice questions, fill-in questions, and so on. I feel I am in the exam instead of answering a questionnaire. I lost my patience because I thought it was unnecessary for many questions. Overall, it is very significant for the designer to learn about the form design so that it will attract more users to fill in the form.

        <p>The article called <i>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</i> gives me a strong sense of the significant existence of modal windows. To be effective, they must achieve a balance between visibility and usability, without overpowering the screen or being too subtle. Their size, placement, and interaction design should improve clarity while not disrupting the user's workflow. Additionally, coherence with the overall design language is required. Modals must also contribute to the intended user experience by communicating information that makes sense. Since they interrupt the main interface, careful execution is required to avoid annoyance and make sure about accessibility. This complicates the challenge of developing models, which must take into account both functional and visual aspects in order to offer an engaging yet non-intrusive experience.

        <p>The article <i>"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</i> captivated me by offering a fresh perspective on how photography can be used to develop visual thinking. Every picture has a backstory that is hidden in addition to the scenario that was photographed. Occasionally, this backstory may differ entirely from how we initially interpreted the picture. 
        </p>

        <p>For instance, a picture of a man fixing a broken pipe really caught my attention. Because he was standing in the water, I initially thought he was in distress. Entry was forbidden by the road markers nearby, and a policeman had pulled over, apparently ignoring the man instead of helping him. But after studying the image's context and reading the title, I came to the conclusion that my presumption was completely wrong. This encounter reaffirmed the notion that deciphering a photograph necessitates more than merely visual inspection; it also entails comprehending the scene in which the picture was captured and what is actually occurring within the frame.

        <h3>First image</h3>
        <p>
            The image captures a creative baking session where a person is photographing a tray of decorated cookies with their phone. The cookies feature playful and eerie designs, including ghosts, black cats, pandas, and pumpkins. The phone screen reflects the cookies, adding an extra layer of visual interest by framing them in a digital perspective. The designs of cookies are detailed and varied. The act of photographing suggests a desire to document or share the experience, making the image feel personal and interactive. The most prominent part of this image is he is celebrating Halloween with friends. The most mysterious part is how they made it and what it is for. Do the cookies for their friends to eat, or will they be shared with some kids who asked for the candy on Halloween? One suggestion is that letting the hand become blurred, reaching for a cookie, could create a dynamic effect. It seems like there are too many elements in one image, which is the main part of the image that easily becomes ignored.

        <h3>Second image</h3>
        <p>This image captures a serene sky transitioning between day and night, with soft pink and purple hues blending into deep blue. This photo was taken on the drive back to Davis from Las Vegas when my parents visited me in the U.S. It was a special trip, as I had come to the U.S. alone for school as an international student, and they traveled here to spend time with me before the start of my sophomore year. I had not been back home for a long time before that, so their visit meant a lot to me. On the way back, I noticed this particularly striking sunset—the sky had a unique blend of colors I had not seen before. Wanting to capture the moment, I took this photo as a way to remember both the beauty of the sky and the significance of that time with my family.

            My topic was about observation of different types of clouds in the sky. It is one kind of cloud called Cirrus. It is a High-altitude cloud and usually in thin, feathery, or streaky formations. It often appears pink, purple, or orange during sunrise and sunset. For future updates, I will draw the shape of the clouds for more information and add text nearby.

        <p>This week, I read <i>Game Design Principles</i>. Adding exciting features and providing users with a seamless user experience are two critical factors in game design. The article outlined the top seven essential game design principles. One of the most important is setting clear goals and objectives. Clear goals help users understand what they need to accomplish in the game. To achieve these goals, players must complete smaller tasks along the way. If they become confused during gameplay, it could lead them in the wrong direction, break their flow and engagement. Another principle that impressed me is balancing the game. Establishing numerical balance is crucial to ensure the game isn't too easy or too difficult. Well-balanced mechanics ensure that players are appropriately challenged without feeling frustrated, which helps maintain player engagement throughout the game.
