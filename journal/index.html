        <p>The article impresses me with its many valuable tips about form design. It also mentions some details that I had overlooked before. Those details are essential to users and will change their desire to complete the form. For example, in the article, 21% of people in the research say that they abandoned the process because of too long/complicated checkout. Therefore, minimizing the input field is the best way for users to continue filling out the form. I agree with it because it happens to me. Once I fill out a form about the desirability of the restaurant, I expect to fill in several easy questions. However, there are multiple-choice questions, fill-in questions, and so on. I feel I am in the exam instead of answering a questionnaire. I lost my patience because I thought it was unnecessary for many questions. Overall, it is very significant for the designer to learn about the form design so that it will attract more users to fill in the form.
