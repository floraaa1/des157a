        <p>The article impresses me with its many valuable tips about form design. It also mentions some details that I had overlooked before. Those details are essential to users and will change their desire to complete the form. For example, in the article, 21% of people in the research say that they abandoned the process because of too long/complicated checkout. Therefore, minimizing the input field is the best way for users to continue filling out the form. I agree with it because it happens to me. Once I fill out a form about the desirability of the restaurant, I expect to fill in several easy questions. However, there are multiple-choice questions, fill-in questions, and so on. I feel I am in the exam instead of answering a questionnaire. I lost my patience because I thought it was unnecessary for many questions. Overall, it is very significant for the designer to learn about the form design so that it will attract more users to fill in the form.

        <p>The article called Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows gives me a strong sense of the significant existence of modal windows. To be effective, they must achieve a balance between visibility and usability, without overpowering the screen or being too subtle. Their size, placement, and interaction design should improve clarity while not disrupting the user's workflow. Additionally, coherence with the overall design language is required. Modals must also contribute to the intended user experience by communicating information that makes sense. Since they interrupt the main interface, careful execution is required to avoid annoyance and make sure about accessibility. This complicates the challenge of developing models, which must take into account both functional and visual aspects in order to offer an engaging yet non-intrusive experience.
